ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: The economy, except for the agricultural sector, had                  
followed the Soviet model of state ownership and control of                     
productive assets. About 75% of agricultural production had come from the       
private sector and the rest from state farms. The economy has presented a       
picture of moderate but slowing growth against a background of underlying       
weaknesses in technology and worker motivation. GNP dropped by 2.0% in          
1989 and by a further 8.9% in 1990. The inflation rate, after falling           
sharply from the 1982 peak of 100% to 22% in 1986, rose to a galloping          
rate of 640% in 1989 and dropped back to 250% in 1990. Shortages of             
consumer goods and some food items worsened in 1988-89. Agricultural            
products and coal are among the biggest hard currency earners, but              
manufactures are increasing in importance. Poland, with its hard currency       
debt of $48.5 billion, is severely limited in its ability to import             
much-needed hard currency goods. The sweeping political changes of 1989         
disrupted normal economic channels and exacerbated shortages. In January        
1990, the new Solidarity-led government adopted a cold turkey program for       
transforming Poland to a market economy. The government moved to                
eliminate subsidies, free prices, make the zloty convertible, and,              
in general, halt the hyperinflation. These financial measures were              
accompanied by plans to privatize the economy in stages. While inflation        
fell to an annual rate of 77.5% by November of 1990, the rise in                
unemployment and the drop in living standards have led to growing popular       
discontent and to a change of government in January 1991. The new               
government is continuing the previous government's economic                     
program, while trying to speed privatization and to better cushion the          
populace from the dislocations associated with reform. Substantial              
outside aid will be needed if Poland is to make a successful transition         
in the 1990s.
