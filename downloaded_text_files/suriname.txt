Overview: The economy is dominated by the bauxite industry, which               
accounts for about 70% of export earnings and 40% of tax revenues. The          
economy has been in trouble since the Dutch ended development aid in            
1982. A drop in world bauxite prices that started in the late 1970s and         
continued until late 1986, was followed by the outbreak of a guerrilla          
insurgency in the interior. The guerrillas targeted the economic                
infrastructure, crippling the important bauxite sector and shutting down        
other export industries. These problems have created high inflation,            
high unemployment, widespread black market activity, and a bad climate          
for foreign investment. A small gain in economic growth of 2.0% was             
registered in 1989 due to reduced guerrilla activity and improved               
international markets for bauxite.
