Overview: Phosphate mining had been the only significant                        
economic activity, but in December 1987 the Australian Government               
closed the mine as no longer economically viable. Plans have been               
under way to reopen the mine and also to build a casino and hotel to            
develop tourism, with a possible opening date during the first half of          
1992.
