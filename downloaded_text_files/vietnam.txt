Overview: This is a centrally planned, developing economy with                  
extensive government ownership and control of productive facilities.            
The economy is primarily agricultural; the sector employs about 65% of          
the labor force and accounts for almost half of GNP. Rice is the staple         
crop; substantial amounts of maize, sorghum, cassava, and sweet potatoes        
are also grown. The government permits sale of surplus grain on the open        
market. Most of the mineral resources are located in the north,                 
including coal, which is an important export item. Oil was discovered           
off the southern coast in 1986 with production reaching 54,000 b/d in           
1990 and expected to increase in the years ahead. Following the                 
end of the war in 1975, heavy-handed government measures undermined             
efforts at an efficient merger of the agricultural resources of the             
south and the industrial resources of the north. The economy remains            
heavily dependent on foreign aid and has received assistance from               
Communist countries, Sweden, and UN agencies. Inflation, although down          
from recent triple-digit levels, is still a major weakness and is               
showing signs of accelerating upwards again. Per capita output is among         
the world's lowest. Since late 1986 the government has sponsored a              
broad reform program that seeks to turn more economic activity over to          
the private sector.
