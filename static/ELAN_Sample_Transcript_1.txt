T000001   Any holiday or festival that you have experienced
TC        00:03:53.690 - 00:03:57.021
S000005   What if I don't celebrate much?
TC        00:03:57.230 - 00:03:59.999
T000001   Think of any special day or event, doesn't have to be a major holiday
TC        00:04:00.210 - 00:04:04.412
S000006   Got it, so we're practicing narrative skills too?

S000003   What about pictures?
TC        00:04:21.220 - 00:04:23.100
T000001   If you have pictures, great! They make your story more engaging
TC        00:04:23.310 - 00:04:26.789

S000001   What if we're nervous speaking in front?
TC        00:04:44.210 - 00:04:46.987
T000001   Practice makes perfect. This is a safe space to practice and improve
TC        00:04:47.200 - 00:04:51.600
S000002   Ok, I think I have an idea already
