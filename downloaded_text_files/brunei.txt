Overview: The economy is a mixture of foreign and domestic                      
entrepreneurship, government regulation and welfare measures, and               
village tradition. It is almost totally supported by exports of                 
crude oil and natural gas, with revenues from the petroleum sector              
accounting for more than 50% of GDP. Per capita GDP of $9,600                   
is among the highest in the Third World, and substantial income from            
overseas investment supplements domestic production. The government             
provides for all medical services and subsidizes food and housing.
