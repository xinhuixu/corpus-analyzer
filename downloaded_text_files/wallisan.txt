Overview: The economy is limited to traditional subsistence                     
agriculture, with about 80% of the labor force earning its livelihood           
from agriculture (coconuts and vegetables), livestock (mostly pigs),            
and fishing. About 4% of the population is employed in government.              
Revenues come from French Government subsidies, licensing of fishing            
rights to Japan and South Korea, import taxes, and remittances from             
expatriate workers in New Caledonia. Wallis and Futuna imports food,            
fuel, clothing, machinery, and transport equipment, but its exports             
are negligible, consisting of copra and handicrafts.
