Overview: Economic activity traditionally has been based on                     
agriculture and the breeding of livestock--Mongolia has the highest             
number of livestock per person in the world. In recent years extensive          
mineral resources have been developed with Soviet support. The mining and       
processing of coal, copper, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold                 
account for a large part of industrial production. In early 1991 the            
Mongolian leadership was struggling with severe economic dislocations,          
mainly attributable to chaotic economic conditions in the USSR, by              
far Mongolia's leading trade and development partner. For example,              
the government doubled most prices in January 1991, and industrial              
production dropped 10% in the first quarter of 1991. Moscow almost              
certainly will be cutting aid in 1991.
