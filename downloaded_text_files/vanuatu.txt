Overview: The economy is based primarily on subsistence farming                 
that provides a living for about 80% of the population. Fishing and             
tourism are the other mainstays of the economy. Mineral deposits are            
negligible; the country has no known petroleum deposits. A small                
light industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues come             
mainly from import duties.
