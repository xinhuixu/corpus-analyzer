Disputes: administered by the UK, claimed by Argentina                          
                                                                                
Climate: variable, with mostly westerly winds throughout the                    
year, interspersed with periods of calm; nearly all precipitation falls         
as snow                                                                         
                                                                                
Terrain: most of the islands, rising steeply from the sea, are                  
rugged and mountainous; South Georgia is largely barren and has steep,          
glacier-covered mountains; the South Sandwich Islands are of volcanic           
origin with some active volcanoes                                               
                                                                                
Natural resources: fish                                                         
                                                                                
Land use: arable land 0%; permanent crops 0%; meadows and                       
pastures 0%; forest and woodland 0%; other 100%; largely covered                
by permanent ice and snow with some sparse vegetation consisting of             
grass, moss, and lichen                                                         
                                                                                
Environment: reindeer, introduced early in this century, live                   
on South Georgia; weather conditions generally make it difficult to             
approach the South Sandwich Islands; the South Sandwich Islands are             
subject to active volcanism                                                     
                                                                                
Note: the north coast of South Georgia has several large bays,                  
which provide good anchorage
