Overview: The newly unified German economy presents a starkly                   
contrasting picture. Western Germany has an advanced market economy             
and is a leading exporter. It experienced faster-than-projected real            
growth largely because of demand in eastern Germany for western German          
goods. Western Germany has a highly urbanized and skilled population            
which enjoys excellent living standards, abundant leisure time, and             
comprehensive social welfare benefits. Western Germany is relatively            
poor in natural resources, coal being the most important mineral.               
Western Germany's world-class companies manufacture technologically             
advanced goods. The region's economy is mature: manufacturing and service       
industries account for the dominant share of economic activity, and raw         
materials and semimanufactured products constitute a large proportion of        
imports. In 1989 manufacturing accounted for 31% of GDP, with other             
sectors contributing lesser amounts. In recent years, gross fixed               
investment has accounted for about 21% of GDP. In 1990 GDP in the western       
region was an estimated $16,300 per capita.                                     
                                                                                
In contrast, eastern Germany's obsolete command economy, once                   
dominated by smokestack heavy industries, has been undergoing a                 
wrenching change to a market economy. Industrial production in early            
1991 is down 50% from the same period last year, due largely to the             
slump in domestic demand for eastern German-made goods and the ongoing          
economic restructuring. The FRG's legal, social welfare, and economic           
systems have been extended to the east, but economic                            
restructuring--privatizing industry, establishing clear property rights,        
clarifying responsibility for environmental clean-up, and removing              
Communist-era holdovers from management--is proceeding slowly                   
so far, deterring outside investors. The region is one of the world's           
largest producers of low-grade lignite coal, but has few other resources.       
The quality of statistics from eastern Germany remains poor; Bonn is            
still trying to bring statistics for the region in line with West German        
practices.                                                                      
                                                                                
The most challenging economic problem of a united Germany is the                
reconstruction of eastern Germany's economy--specifically, finding the          
right mix of fiscal, regulatory, monetary, and tax policies that                
will spur investment in the east without derailing western Germany's            
healthy economy or damaging relations with Western partners. The                
biggest danger is that soaring unemployment in eastern Germany, which           
could climb to the 30 to 40% range, could touch off labor disputes              
or renewed mass relocation to western Germany and erode investor                
confidence in eastern Germany. Overall economic activity grew an                
estimated 4.6% in western Germany in 1990, while dropping roughly 15% in        
eastern Germany. Per capita GDP in the eastern region was approximately         
$8,700 in 1990.
