Overview: Since 1962, when France stationed military personnel in               
the region, French Polynesia has changed from a subsistence economy to          
one in which a high proportion of the work force is either employed by          
the military or supports the tourist industry. Tourism accounts for about       
20% of GDP and is a primary source of hard currency earnings.
