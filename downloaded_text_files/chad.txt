Overview: The climate, geographic location, and lack of                         
infrastructure and natural resources potential make Chad one of the most        
underdeveloped countries in the world. Its economy is burdened by               
the ravages of civil war, conflict with Libya, drought, and food                
shortages. In 1986 real GDP returned to its 1977 level, with cotton,            
the major cash crop, accounting for 48% of exports. Over 80%                    
of the work force is employed in subsistence farming and fishing.               
Industry is based almost entirely on the processing of agricultural             
products, including cotton, sugarcane, and cattle. Chad is highly               
dependent on foreign aid, with its economy in trouble and many regions          
suffering from shortages. Oil companies are exploring areas north of            
Lake Chad and in the Doba basin in the south.                                   
                                                                                
GDP: $1,015 million, per capita $205; real growth rate 0.9% (1989
