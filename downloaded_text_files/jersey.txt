Overview: The economy is based largely on financial services,                   
agriculture, and tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially       
flowers are important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey        
breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide and represents an important            
export earner. Milk products go to the UK and other EC countries. In 1986       
the finance sector overtook tourism as the main contributor to GDP,             
accounting for 40% of the island's output. In recent years the government       
has encouraged light industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that         
an electronics industry has developed alongside the traditional                 
manufacturing of knitwear. All raw material and energy requirements are         
imported, as well as a large share of Jersey's food needs.
