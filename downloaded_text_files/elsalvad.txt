ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: The agricultural sector accounts for 25% of GDP, employs              
about 40% of the labor force, and contributes about 66% to total exports.       
Coffee is the major commercial crop, accounting for 45% of export               
earnings. The manufacturing sector, based largely on food and beverage          
processing, accounts for 18% of GDP and 15% of employment. Economic             
losses because of guerrilla sabotage total more than $2.0 billion               
since 1979. The costs of maintaining a large military seriously                 
constrain the government's efforts to provide essential social services.        
Nevertheless, growth in national output last year exceeded growth in            
population for the first time since 1987.
