S000001   So, it's like saying 'brother' in English?
TC        00:00:10.500 - 00:00:12.300
T000001   Exactly, but in our target language, the word carries more cultural significance.

S000002   How do you say 'sister' then?

S000002   Is there a generic term for cousins, or is it gender-specific?
TC        00:00:40.220 - 00:00:42.679
T000001   It's gender-specific. Here are both terms...
