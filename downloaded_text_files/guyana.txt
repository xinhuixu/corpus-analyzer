Overview: After growing on average at less than 1% a year in                    
1986-87, GDP dropped by 3% a year in 1988-89. The decline resulted from         
bad weather, labor trouble in the canefields, and flooding and equipment        
problems in the bauxite industry. Consumer prices rose about 35% in 1988        
and by over 100% in 1989, and the current account deficit widened               
substantially as sugar and bauxite exports fell. Moreover, electric             
power is in short supply and constitutes a major barrier to future gains        
in national output. The government, in association with international           
financial agencies, seeks to reduce its payment arrears and to raise new        
funds. The government's stabilization program--aimed at establishing            
realistic exchange rates, reasonable price stability, and a resumption of       
growth--requires considerable public administrative abilities and               
continued patience by consumers during a long incubation period.
