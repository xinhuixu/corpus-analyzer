Overview: Tokelau's small size, isolation, and lack of resources                
greatly restrain economic development and confine agriculture to the            
subsistence level. The people must rely on aid from New Zealand to              
maintain public services, annual aid being substantially greater than           
GDP. The principal sources of revenue come from sales of copra, postage         
stamps, souvenir coins, and handicrafts. Money is also remitted to              
families from relatives in New Zealand.
