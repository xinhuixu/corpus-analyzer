Overview: Economic performance is closely tied to the fortunes of               
the oil industry. Petroleum accounts for nearly all export earnings,            
about 80% of government revenues, and roughly 40% of GDP. Oman has              
proved oil reserves of 4 billion barrels, equivalent to about 20 years'         
supply at the current rate of extraction.  Although agriculture employs a       
majority of the population, urban centers depend on imported food.
