Overview: As an affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada                  
today closely resembles the US in per capita output, market-oriented            
economic system, and pattern of production. Since World War II the              
impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has         
transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily          
industrial and urban. In the 1980s Canada registered one of the highest         
rates of real growth among the OECD nations, averaging about 3.2%. With         
its great natural resources, skilled labor force, and modern capital            
plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects. In mid-1990, however, the       
long-simmering problems between English- and French-speaking areas              
became so acute that observers spoke openly of a possible split in the          
confederation; foreign investors were becoming edgy.
