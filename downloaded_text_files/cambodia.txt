Overview: Cambodia is a desperately poor country whose economic                 
development has been stymied by deadly political infighting. The                
economy is based on agriculture and related industries.  Over the               
past decade Cambodia has been slowly recovering from its near destruction       
by war and political upheaval. It still remains, however, one of the            
world's poorest countries, with an estimated per capita GDP of about            
$130.  The food situation is precarious; during the 1980s famine has            
been averted only through international relief. In 1986 the production          
level of rice, the staple food crop, was able to meet only 80% of               
domestic needs. The biggest success of the nation's recovery program has        
been in new rubber plantings and in fishing. Industry, other than rice          
processing, is almost nonexistent. Foreign trade is primarily with the          
USSR and Vietnam. Statistical data on the economy continues to be sparse        
and unreliable. Foreign aid from the USSR and Eastern Europe almost             
certainly is being slashed.
