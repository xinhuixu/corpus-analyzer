Overview: The economy is heavily dependent on subsistence                       
agriculture, which accounts for about 35% of GDP and provides                   
employment for 78% of the labor force. Primary agricultural exports are         
cocoa, coffee, and cotton, which together account for about 30% of total        
export earnings. Togo is self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs when               
harvests are normal. In the industrial sector phosphate mining is by            
far the most important activity, with phosphate exports accounting for          
about 40% of total foreign exchange earnings. Togo serves as a regional         
commercial and trade center. The government actively encourages foreign         
investment.
