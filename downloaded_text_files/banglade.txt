Overview: Bangladesh is one of the poorest nations in the world.                
The economy is based on the output of a narrow range of                         
agricultural products, such as jute, which is the main cash crop and            
major source of export earnings. Bangladesh is hampered by a relative           
lack of natural resources, population growth of more than 2% a year,            
large-scale unemployment, and a limited infrastructure; furthermore,            
it is highly vulnerable to natural disasters. Despite these constraints,        
real GDP growth averaged about 3.5% annually during 1985-89. A strong           
agricultural performance in FY90 pushed the growth rate up to 5.5%.             
Alleviation of poverty remains the cornerstone of the government's              
development strategy.
