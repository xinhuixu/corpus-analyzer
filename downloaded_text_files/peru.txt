note--the 1979 Constitution and legislation enacted from 1987 to                
1990 mandate the creation of regions (regiones, singular--region)               
intended to function eventually as autonomous economic and                      
administrative entities; so far, 12 regions have been constituted               
from 23 existing departments--Amazonas (from Loreto), Andres                    
Avelino Caceres (from Huanuco, Pasco, Junin), Arequipa (from                    
Arequipa), Chavin (from Ancash), Grau (from Tumbes, Piura), Inca                
(from Cusco, Madre de Dios, Apurimac), La Libertad (from La Libertad),

(from Moquegua, Tacna, Puno), Nor Oriental del Maranon (from                    
Lambayeque, Cajamarca, Amazonas), San Martin (from San Martin),                 
Ucayali (from Ucayali); formation of another region has been delayed by         
the reluctance of the constitutional province of Callao to merge with the       
department of Lima; because of inadequate funding from the central              
government, the regions have yet to assume their reponsibilities and at         
the moment co-exist with the departmental structure

Overview: The Peruvian economy is basically capitalistic, with a                
large dose of government welfare programs and government management of          
credit. In the 1980s the economy suffered from hyperinflation,                  
declining per capita output, and mounting external debt. Peru was shut          
off from IMF and World Bank support in the mid-1980s because of its             
huge debt arrears. An austerity program implemented shortly after the           
Fujimori government took office in July 1990 contributed to a third             
consecutive yearly contraction of economic activity, but was able to            
generate a small recovery in the last quarter. After a burst of                 
inflation as the program eliminated government price subsidies, monthly         
price increases eased to the single-digit level for the first time              
since mid-1988. Lima has restarted current payments to multilateral             
lenders and, although it faces $14 billion in arrears on its external           
debt, is working toward an accommodation with its creditors.
