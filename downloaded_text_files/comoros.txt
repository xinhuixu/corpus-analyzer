archipelago--Mwali, Njazidja, Nzwani, and Mayotte (which is a territorial       
collectivity of France, but claimed by the Comoros)                             
                                                                                
ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made                 
up of several islands that have poor transportation links, a young and          
rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources. The low               
educational level of the labor force contributes to a low level of              
economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign         
grants and technical assistance. Agriculture, including fishing and             
forestry, is the leading sector of the economy. It contributes about 40%        
to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports.       
The country is not self-sufficient in food production, and rice, the main       
staple, accounts for 90% of imports. During the period 1982-86 the              
industrial sector grew at an annual average rate of 5.3%, but its               
contribution to GDP was only 5% in 1988. Despite major investment in the        
tourist industry, which accounts for about 25% of GDP, growth has               
stagnated since 1983. A sluggish growth rate of 1.5% during 1985-90 has         
led to large budget deficits, declining incomes, and balance-of-payments        
difficulties.
