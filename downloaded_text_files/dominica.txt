Overview: The economy is largely dependent on trade; imported                   
components average 60% of the value of goods consumed in the domestic           
market. Rapid growth of free trade zones has established a significant          
expansion of manufacturing for export, especially wearing apparel.              
Over the past decade tourism has also increased in importance and is a          
major earner of foreign exchange and a source of new jobs. Agriculture          
remains a key sector of the economy. The principal commercial crop is           
sugarcane, followed by coffee, cotton, cocoa, and tobacco. Domestic             
industry is based on the processing of agricultural products, durable           
consumer goods, minerals, and chemicals. Unemployment is officially             
reported at about 30%, but there is considerable underemployment. An            
increasing foreign debt burden and galloping inflation are the economy's        
greatest weaknesses.
