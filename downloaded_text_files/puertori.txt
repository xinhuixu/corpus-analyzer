Overview: Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the              
Caribbean region. Industry has surpassed agriculture as the primary             
sector of economic activity and income. Encouraged by duty-free                 
access to the US and by tax incentives, US firms have invested heavily          
in Puerto Rico since the 1950s. Important new industries include                
pharmaceuticals, electronics, textiles, petrochemicals, and processed           
foods. Sugar production has lost out to dairy production and other              
livestock products as the main source of income in the agricultural             
sector. Tourism has traditionally been an important source of income            
for the island. The economy is slowly recovering from the disruptions           
caused by Hurricane Hugo in September 1989. The tourism infrastructure          
was especially hard hit.
