Overview: The exploitation of oil and natural gas products forms                
the backbone of the economy. Algeria depends on hydrocarbons for nearly         
all of its export receipts, about 30% of government revenues, and nearly        
25% of GDP. In 1973-74 the sharp increase in oil prices led to a booming        
economy and helped to finance an ambitious program of industrialization.        
Plunging oil and gas prices, combined with the mismanagement of Algeria's       
highly centralized economy, have brought the nation to its most serious         
social and economic crisis since independence. The government has               
promised far-reaching reforms, including giving public-sector companies         
more autonomy, encouraging private-sector activity, boosting gas and            
nonhydrocarbon exports, and proposing a major overhaul of the banking           
and financial systems, but to date has made little progress.
