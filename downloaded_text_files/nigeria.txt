Overview: Although Nigeria is Africa's leading oil-producing                    
country, it remains poor with a $280 per capita GDP. In 1990, despite           
rising oil prices and a sharp drop in inflation, performance remained           
slack with continuing underutilization of industrial capacity and a             
second year of relatively weak agricultural performance. Agricultural           
production was up only 4.2% in 1990, still below the 1987 level.                
Industrial output showed a 7.2% increase, but remained below the 1985           
level. Government efforts to reduce Nigeria's dependence on oil exports         
and to sustain noninflationary growth have fallen short due to inadequate       
new investment funds. Living standards continue to deteriorate from the         
higher level of the early 1980s oil boom.
