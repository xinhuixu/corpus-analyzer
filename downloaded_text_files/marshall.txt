ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: Agriculture and tourism are the mainstays of the economy.             
Agricultural production is concentrated on small farms, and the most            
important commercial crops are coconuts, tomatoes, melons, and                  
breadfruit. A few cattle ranches supply the domestic meat market.               
Small-scale industry is limited to handicrafts, fish processing, and            
copra. The tourist industry is the primary source of foreign exchange and       
employs about 10% of the labor force. The islands have few natural              
resources, and imports far exceed exports. In 1987 the US Government            
provided grants of $40 million out of the Marshallese budget of                 
$55 million.
