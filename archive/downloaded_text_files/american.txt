Overview: Economic development is strongly linked to the US, with               
which American Samoa does 90% of its foreign trade. Tuna fishing and tuna       
processing plants are the backbone of the private-sector economy, with          
canned tuna the primary export. The tuna canneries are the second-largest       
employer, exceeded only by the government. Other economic activities            
include meat canning, handicrafts, dairy farming, and a slowly developing       
tourist industry.
