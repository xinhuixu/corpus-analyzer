ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: The stable economy features moderate growth, low                      
inflation, and negligible unemployment. Agriculture is based on small but       
highly productive family-owned farms. The industrial sector, until              
recently dominated by steel, has become increasingly more diversified,          
particularly toward high-technology firms. During the past decade, growth       
in the financial sector has more than compensated for the decline in            
steel. Services, especially banking, account for a growing proportion           
of the economy. Luxembourg participates in an economic union with               
Belgium on trade and most financial matters and is also closely connected       
economically to the Netherlands.
