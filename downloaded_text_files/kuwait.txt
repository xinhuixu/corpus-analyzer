Overview: Up to the invasion by Iraq in August 1990, the oil                    
sector had dominated the economy. Kuwait has the third-largest                  
oil reserves in the world after Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Earnings from            
hydrocarbons generated over 90% of both export and government revenues          
and contributed about 40% to GDP. Most of the nonoil sector has                 
traditionally been dependent upon oil-derived government revenues.              
Iraq's destruction of Kuwait's oil industry during the Gulf war                 
has devastated the economy. Iraq destroyed or damaged more than 80%             
of Kuwait's 950 operating oil wells, as well as sabotaging key surface          
facilities. Western firefighters had brought about 140 of the 600               
oil well fires and blowouts under control as of early June 1991.                
It could take two to three years to restore Kuwait's oil production to          
its prewar level of about 2.0 million barrels per day.
