Overview: The economic reforms that Turkey launched in 1980                     
continue to bring an impressive stream of benefits. The economy has grown       
steadily since the early 1980s, with real growth in per capita GDP              
increasing more than 6% annually. Agriculture remains the most important        
economic sector, employing about 55% of the labor force, accounting for         
almost 20% of GDP, and contributing about 20% to exports. Impressive            
growth in recent years has not solved all of the economic problems facing       
Turkey. Inflation and interest rates remain high, and a large budget            
deficit will continue to provide difficulties for a country undergoing a        
substantial transformation from a centrally controlled to a free market         
economy. The government has launched a multimillion-dollar development          
program in the southeastern region, which includes the building of a            
dozen dams on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers to generate electric power        
and irrigate large tracts of farmland. The planned tapping of huge              
additional quantities of Euphrates water has raised serious concern in          
the downstream riparian nations of Syria and Iraq.
