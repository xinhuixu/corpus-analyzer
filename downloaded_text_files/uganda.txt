Overview: Uganda has substantial natural resources, including                   
fertile soils, regular rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of copper         
and cobalt. The economy has been devastated by much political                   
instability, mismanagement, and civil war since independence in 1962,           
keeping Uganda poor with a per capita income of about $300. (GDP remains        
below the levels of the early 1970s, as does industrial production.)            
Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy, employing over         
80% of the work force. Coffee is the major export crop and accounts             
for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986 the government has                  
acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking                  
currency reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing            
petroleum prices, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes         
are especially aimed at dampening inflation, which was running at over          
300% in 1987, and boosting production and export earnings.

Overview: The UAE has an open economy with one of the world's                   
highest incomes per capita outside the OECD nations. This wealth is based       
on oil and gas, and the fortunes of the economy fluctuate with the prices       
of those commodities. Since 1973, when petroleum prices shot up, the UAE        
has undergone a profound transformation from an impoverished region of          
small desert principalities to a modern state with a high standard of           
living. At present levels of production, crude oil reserves should last         
for over 100 years.
