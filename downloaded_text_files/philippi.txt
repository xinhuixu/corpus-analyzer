Overview: The economy continues to recover from the political                   
turmoil following the ouster of former President Marcos and several coup        
attempts. After two consecutive years of economic contraction (1984 and         
1985), the economy has since 1986 had positive growth, although in 1990         
the economy slowed considerably from 1989. The agricultural sector              
together with forestry and fishing, plays an important role in the              
economy, employing about 45% of the work force and providing almost             
30% of GDP. The Philippines is the world's largest exporter of coconuts         
and coconut products. Manufacturing contributes about 25% of GDP. Major         
industries include food processing, chemicals, and textiles.
