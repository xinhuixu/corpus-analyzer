Flag: three equal vertical bands of red (hoist side), yellow, and               
green with a large black letter R centered in the yellow band; uses             
the popular pan-African colors of Ethiopia; similar to the flag of              
Guinea, which has a plain yellow band                                           
                                                                                
ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: Almost 50% of GDP comes from the agricultural sector;                 
coffee and tea make up 80-90% of total exports. The amount of fertile           
land is limited, however, and deforestation and soil erosion have created       
problems. The industrial sector in Rwanda is small, contributing only           
16% to GDP. Manufacturing focuses mainly on the processing of                   
agricultural products. The Rwandan economy remains dependent on coffee          
exports and foreign aid, with no relief in sight. Weak international            
prices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita            
GDP to decline. A structural adjustment program with the World Bank             
began in October 1990. An outbreak of insurgency, also in October, has          
dampened any prospects for economic improvement.
