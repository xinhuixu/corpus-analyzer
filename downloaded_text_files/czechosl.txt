Overview: Czechoslovakia is highly industrialized and has a                     
well-educated and skilled labor force. Its industry, transport, energy          
sources, banking, and most other means of production are state owned. The       
country is deficient, however, in energy and in many raw materials.             
Moreover, its aging capital plant lags well behind West European                
standards. Industry contributes almost 50% to GNP and construction              
contributes 10%. About 95% of agricultural land is in collectives or            
state farms. The centrally planned economy has been tightly linked in           
trade (80%) to the USSR and Eastern Europe. Growth has been sluggish,           
averaging less than 2% in the period 1982-89. GNP per capita is the             
highest in Eastern Europe. As in the rest of Eastern Europe, the sweeping       
political changes of 1989-90 have been disrupting normal channels of            
supply and compounding the government's economic problems. Having eased         
restrictions on private enterprise in 1990 and having adjusted some key         
prices, Czechoslovakia is now implementing a broad two-year program             
to make the difficult transition from a command to a market economy.            
Inflation and unemployment are beginning to rise, albeit from                   
comparatively low levels.
