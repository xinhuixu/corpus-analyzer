Overview: Ivory Coast is among the world's largest producers                    
and exporters of coffee, cocoa beans, and palm-kernel oil. Consequently,        
the economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices         
for coffee and cocoa and to weather conditions. Despite attempts by the         
government to diversify, the economy is still largely dependent on              
agriculture and related industries. The agricultural sector accounts for        
over one-third of GDP and about 80% of export earnings and employs about        
85% of the labor force. A collapse of world cocoa and coffee prices in          
1986 threw the economy into a recession, from which the country had not         
recovered by 1990.
