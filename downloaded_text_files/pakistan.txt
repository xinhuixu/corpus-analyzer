ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: Pakistan is a poor Third World country faced with the                 
usual problems of rapidly increasing population, sizable government             
deficits, and heavy dependence on foreign aid. In addition, the economy         
must support a large military establishment and provide for the needs of        
4 million Afghan refugees. A real economic growth rate averaging 5-6% in        
recent years has enabled the country to cope with these problems. Almost        
all agriculture and small-scale industry is in private hands, and the           
government seeks to privatize a portion of the large-scale industrial           
enterprises now publicly owned. In December 1988, Pakistan signed a             
three-year economic reform agreement with the IMF, which provides for a         
reduction in the government deficit and a liberalization of trade in            
return for further IMF financial support. Late in 1990, the IMF                 
suspended assistance to Pakistan because the government failed to               
follow through on deficit reforms. Pakistan almost certainly will make          
little headway on raising living standards for its rapidly expanding            
population; at the current rate of growth, population would double in           
29 years.
