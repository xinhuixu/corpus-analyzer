Overview: Argentina is rich in natural resources and has a highly               
literate population, an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a              
diversified industrial base. Nevertheless, following decades of                 
mismanagement and statist policies, the economy has encountered                 
major problems in recent years, leading to escalating inflation and             
a recession in 1988-90. A widening public-sector deficit and a                  
multidigit inflation rate have dominated the economy over the past              
three years; retail prices rose nearly 5,000% in 1989 and another               
1,345% in 1990. Since 1978, Argentina's external debt has nearly doubled        
to $60 billion, creating severe debt-servicing difficulties and hurting         
the country's creditworthiness with international lenders.
