ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: This modern economy features high-tech                                
agriculture, up-to-date small-scale and corporate industry, extensive           
government welfare measures, comfortable living standards, and high             
dependence on foreign trade. The Danish economy is likely to maintain           
its slow but steady improvement in 1991. GDP grew by 1.3% in 1990               
and probably will grow by about 1.25% in 1991; unemployment is running          
close to 10%. In 1990 Denmark had the lowest inflation rate in the EC,          
a record trade surplus, and the first balance-of-payments surplus in            
26 years. As the government prepares for the economic integration of            
Europe during 1992, growth, investment, and competitiveness are expected        
to improve, reducing unemployment, inflation, and debt.
