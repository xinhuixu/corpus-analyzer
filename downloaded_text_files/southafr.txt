ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: Many of the white one-seventh of the South African                    
population enjoy incomes, material comforts, and health and educational         
standards equal to those of Western Europe. In contrast, most of the            
remaining population suffers from the poverty patterns of the Third             
World, including unemployment, lack of job skills, and barriers to              
movement into higher-paying fields. Inputs and outputs thus do not move         
smoothly into the most productive employments, and the effectiveness            
of the market is further lowered by international constraints on                
dealings with South Africa. The main strength of the economy lies in            
its rich mineral resources, which provide two-thirds of exports.                
Average growth of less than 2% in output in recent years falls far short        
of the 5-6% level needed to cut into the high unemployment rate.
