Overview: Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with considerable             
government guidance of investment and foreign trade and partial                 
government ownership of some large banks and industrial firms. Real             
growth in GNP has averaged about 9% a year during the past three decades.       
Export growth has been even faster and has provided the impetus for             
industrialization. Agriculture contributes about 4% to GNP, down from 35%       
in 1952. Taiwan currently ranks as number 13 among major trading                
countries. Traditional labor-intensive industries are steadily being            
replaced with more capital- and technology-intensive industries.
