Overview: Since World War II the economy has changed from one based             
on agriculture into a ranking industrial economy, with approximately the        
same total and per capita output as France and the UK. The country is           
still divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by small             
private companies, and an undeveloped agricultural south, dominated by          
large public enterprises. Services account for 48% of GDP, industry 34%,        
agriculture 4%, and public administration 13%. Most raw materials needed        
by industry and over 75% of energy requirements must be imported. The           
economic recovery that began in mid-1983 has continued through 1990, with       
the economy growing at an annual average rate of 3%. For the 1990s, Italy       
faces the problems of refurbishing a tottering communications system,           
curbing pollution in major industrial centers, and adjusting to the new         
competitive forces accompanying the ongoing economic integration of the         
European Community.
