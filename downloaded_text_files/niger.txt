ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: About 90% of the population is engaged in farming and                 
stock rearing, activities which generate almost half the national               
income. The economy also depends heavily on exploitation of large uranium       
deposits. Uranium production grew rapidly in the mid-1970s, but tapered         
off in the early 1980s, when world prices declined. France is a major           
customer, while Germany, Japan, and Spain also make regular purchases.          
The depressed demand for uranium has contributed to an overall                  
sluggishness in the economy, a severe trade imbalance, and a mounting           
external debt.
