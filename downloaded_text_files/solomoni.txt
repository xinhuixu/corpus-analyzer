Overview: About 90% of the population depend on subsistence                     
agriculture, fishing, and forestry for at least part of their livelihood.       
Agriculture, fishing, and forestry contribute about 75% to GDP, with the        
fishing and forestry sectors being important export earners. The service        
sector contributes about 25% to GDP. Most manufactured goods and                
petroleum products must be imported. The islands are rich in undeveloped        
mineral resources such as lead, zinc, nickel, and gold. The economy             
suffered from a severe cyclone in mid-1986 that caused widespread damage        
to the infrastructure.
