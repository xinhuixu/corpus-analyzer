Overview: India's economy is a mixture of traditional                           
village farming and handicrafts, modern agriculture, old and new branches       
of industry, and a multitude of support services. It presents both the          
entrepreneurial skills and drives of the capitalist system and                  
widespread government intervention of the socialist mold. Growth of 4%          
to 5% annually in the 1980s has softened the impact of population growth        
on unemployment, social tranquility, and the environment. Agricultural          
output has continued to expand, reflecting the greater use of modern            
farming techniques and improved seed that have helped to make India             
self-sufficient in food grains and a net agricultural exporter. However,        
tens of millions of villagers, particularly in the south, have not              
benefited from the green revolution and live in abject poverty. Industry        
has benefited from a partial liberalization of controls. The growth rate        
of the service sector has also been strong. India, however, has been            
challenged more recently by much lower foreign exchange reserves, higher        
inflation, and a large debt service burden.
