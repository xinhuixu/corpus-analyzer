ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: More than 90% of this command economy is socialized;                  
agricultural land is collectivized; and state-owned industry produces 95%       
of manufactured goods. State control of economic affairs is unusually           
tight even for a Communist country because of the small size and                
homogeneity of the society and the strict one-man rule of Kim. Economic         
growth during the period 1984-90 averaged approximately 3%. Abundant            
natural resources and hydropower form the basis of industrial                   
development. Output of the extractive industries includes coal, iron ore,       
magnesite, graphite, copper, zinc, lead, and precious metals.                   
Manufacturing emphasis is centered on heavy industry, with light industry       
lagging far behind. Despite the use of high-yielding seed varieties,            
expansion of irrigation, and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea          
has not yet become self-sufficient in food production. Four consecutive         
years of poor harvests, coupled with distribution problems, have led to         
chronic food shortages. North Korea remains far behind South Korea in           
economic development and living standards.
