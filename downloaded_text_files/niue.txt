Overview: The economy is heavily dependent on aid from New                      
Zealand. Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the            
shortfall made up by grants from New Zealand--the grants are used to pay        
wages to public employees. The agricultural sector consists mainly of           
subsistence gardening, although some cash crops are grown for export.           
Industry consists primarily of small factories to process passion fruit,        
lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of postage stamps to foreign       
collectors is an important source of revenue. The island in recent years        
has suffered a serious loss of population because of migration of Niueans
