offshore banking and oil refining and storage are also important.               
Hotel capacity expanded rapidly between 1985 and 1989 and nearly                
doubled in 1990 alone. Unemployment has steadily declined from about            
20% in 1986 to about 2% in 1990. The reopening of the local oil                 
refinery, once a major source of employment and foreign exchange                
earnings, promises to give the economy an additional boost.
