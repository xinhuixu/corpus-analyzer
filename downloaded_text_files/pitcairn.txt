Overview: The inhabitants exist on fishing and subsistence farming.             
The fertile soil of the valleys produces a wide variety of fruits and           
vegetables, including citrus, sugarcane, watermelons, bananas, yams, and        
beans. Bartering is an important part of the economy. The major sources         
of revenue are the sale of postage stamps to collectors and the sale of         
handicrafts to passing ships.
