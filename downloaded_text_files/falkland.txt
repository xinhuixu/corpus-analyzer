raising is the major economic activity) above the sailing ship Desire           
(whose crew discovered the islands) with a scroll at the bottom bearing         
the motto DESIRE THE RIGHT

Overview: The economy is based on sheep farming, which directly or              
indirectly employs most of the work force. A few dairy herds are kept to        
meet domestic consumption of milk and milk products, and crops grown are        
primarily those for providing winter fodder. Exports feature shipments          
of high-grade wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins.          
Rich stocks of fish in the surrounding waters are not presently exploited       
by the islanders. So far efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry       
have been unsuccessful. In 1987 the government began selling                    
fishing licenses to foreign trawlers operating within the Falklands             
exclusive fishing zone. These license fees amount to more than $40              
million per year and are a primary source of income for the                     
government. To encourage tourism, the Falkland Islands Development              
Corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the
