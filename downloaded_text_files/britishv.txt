Overview: The economy is highly dependent on the tourist industry,              
which generates about 21% of the national income. In 1985 the government        
offered offshore registration to companies wishing to incorporate in            
the islands, and, in consequence, incorporation fees generated about $2         
million in 1987. Livestock raising is the most significant agricultural         
activity. The islands' crops, limited by poor soils, are unable to meet         
food requirements.                                                              
                                                                                
GDP: $106.7 million, per capita $8,900; real growth rate 2.5%
