Overview: For 20 years Communist Yugoslavia had been trying to                  
replace the Stalinist command economy with a decentralized semimarket           
system that features worker self-management councils in all large plants.       
This hybrid system neared collapse in late 1989 when inflation soared.          
The government applied shock therapy in 1990 under an IMF standby               
program that provides tight control over monetary expansion, a freeze           
on wages, the pegging of the dinar to the deutsche mark, and a partial          
price freeze on energy, transportation, and communal services. This             
program brought hyperinflation to a halt and encouraged a rise in               
foreign investment. Since June 1990, however, inflation has                     
rebounded and threatens to rise further in 1991. Estimated annual               
inflation for 1990 is 164%. Other huge problems remain: rising                  
unemployment, the low quality of industrial output, and striking                
differences in income between the poorer southern regions and the               
comparatively well-off northern areas. Even so, political issues far            
outweigh economic problems in importance.
