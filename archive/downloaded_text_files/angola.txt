Overview: Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for              
80 to 90% of the population, but accounts for less than 15% of GDP. Oil         
production is the most lucrative sector of the economy, contributing            
about 50% to GDP. In recent years, however, the impact of fighting an           
internal war has severely affected the nonoil economy, and food has to be       
imported.  For the long run, Angola has the advantage of rich natural           
resources, notably gold, diamonds, and arable land.  To realize its             
economic potential Angola not only must secure domestic peace but also          
must reform government policies that have led to distortions and                
imbalances throughout the economy.
