Overview: Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world.              
During the period 1980-85 it had a population growth of 3% a year and           
a - 0.4% GDP growth rate. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is       
the mainstay of the economy, accounting for over 40% of GDP, employing          
about 80% of the labor force, and contributing to more than 70% of total        
export earnings. Industry is largely confined to the processing of              
agricultural products and textile manufacturing; in 1990 it accounted for       
only 16% of GDP and employed 3% of the labor force. In 1986 the                 
government introduced a five-year development plan that stresses                
self-sufficiency in food (mainly rice) by 1990, increased production for        
exports, and reduced energy imports.
