Overview: Agriculture, dominated by banana production, is the most              
important sector of the economy. The services sector, based mostly on           
a growing tourist industry, is also important. The economy continues to         
have a high unemployment rate of 30% because of an overdependence on the        
weather-plagued banana crop as a major export earner. Government progress       
toward diversifying into new industries has been relatively unsuccessful.
