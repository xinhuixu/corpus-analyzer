Communists: PCE membership declined from a possible high of                     
160,000 in 1977 to roughly 60,000 in 1987; the party gained almost              
1 million voters and 10 deputies in the 1989 election; voters came              
mostly from the disgruntled socialist left; remaining strength is in            
labor, where it dominates the Workers Commissions trade union (one of           
the country's two major labor centrals), which claims a membership of           
about 1 million; experienced a modest recovery in 1986 national                 
election, nearly doubling the share of the vote it received in 1982             
                                                                                
Other political or pressure groups: on the extreme left, the Basque             
Fatherland and Liberty (ETA) and the First of October Antifascist               
Resistance Group (GRAPO) use terrorism to oppose the government; free           
labor unions (authorized in April 1977) include the Communist-dominated         
Workers Commissions (CCOO); the Socialist General Union of Workers (UGT),       
and the smaller independent Workers Syndical Union (USO); the Catholic          
Church; business and landowning interests; Opus Dei; university students

Overview: This Western capitalistic economy has done well since                 
Spain joined the EC in 1986. With annual increases in real GNP averaging        
about 5% in the 1987-90 period, Spain has been the fastest growing member       
of the EC. Increased investment--both domestic and foreign--has been the        
most important factor pushing the economic expansion. Inflation moderated       
to 4.8% in 1988, but an overheated economy caused inflation to reach            
almost 7% in 1989-90. Another economic problem facing Spain is an               
unemployment rate of 16.3%, the highest in Europe.
