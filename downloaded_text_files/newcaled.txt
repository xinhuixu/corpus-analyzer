Overview: New Caledonia has more than 25% of the world's known                  
nickel resources. In recent years the economy has suffered because of           
depressed international demand for nickel, the principal source of export       
earnings. Only a negligible amount of the land is suitable for                  
cultivation, and food accounts for about 25% of imports.
