ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: The UK is one of the world's great trading powers and                 
financial centers, and its economy ranks among the four largest in              
Europe. The economy is essentially capitalistic with a generous admixture       
of social welfare programs and government ownership. Over the last decade       
the Thatcher government halted the expansion of welfare measures and            
promoted extensive reprivatization of the government economic sector.           
Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European          
standards, producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labor          
force. Industry is a mixture of public and private enterprises, employing       
about 27% of the work force and generating 22% of GDP. The UK is an             
energy-rich nation with large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves;              
primary energy production accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest           
shares of any industrial nation. In mid-1990 the economy fell into              
recession after eight years of strong economic expansion, which had             
raised national output by one quarter. Britain's inflation rate, which          
has been consistently well above those of her major trading partners,           
is expected to decline in 1991. Between 1986 and 1990 unemployment              
fell from 11% to about 6%, but it is now rising rapidly because of              
the economic slowdown. As a major trading nation, the UK will continue          
to be greatly affected by world boom or recession, swings in the                
international oil market, productivity trends in domestic industry,             
and the terms on which the economic integration of Europe proceeds.
