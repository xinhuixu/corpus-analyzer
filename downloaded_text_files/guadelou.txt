Overview: The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light                    
industry, and services. It is also dependent upon France for large              
subsidies and imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists from       
the US. In addition, an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit         
the islands. The traditionally important sugarcane crop is slowly being         
replaced by other crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50% of         
export earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root crops        
are cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is still              
dependent on imported food, which comes mainly from France. Light               
industry consists mostly of sugar and rum production. Most manufactured         
goods and fuel are imported. Unemployment is especially high among the          
young.
