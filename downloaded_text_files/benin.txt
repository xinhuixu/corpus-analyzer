Overview: Benin is one of the least developed countries in the                  
world because of limited natural resources and a poorly developed               
infrastructure. Agriculture accounts for almost 40% of GDP, employs             
about 60% of the labor force, and generates a major share of foreign            
exchange earnings. The industrial sector contributes only about 15% to          
GDP and employs 2% of the work force. Persistently low prices in recent         
years have limited hard currency earnings from Benin's major exports of         
agricultural products and crude oil.
