Overview: Petroleum is the cornerstone of the economy and accounted             
for 21% of GDP, 60% of central government revenues, and 81% of export           
earnings in 1989. President Perez introduced an economic readjustment           
program when he assumed office in February 1989. Lower tariffs and              
price supports, a free market exchange rate, and market-linked interest         
rates have thrown the economy into confusion, causing about an 8%               
decline in GDP in 1989, but the economy recovered part way in 1990.
