ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: The economy is essentially agricultural and centers on                
the traditional production of spices and tropical plants. Agriculture           
accounts for about 16% of GDP and 80% of exports and employs 24% of the         
labor force. Tourism is the leading foreign exchange earner, followed by        
agricultural exports. Manufacturing remains relatively undeveloped, but         
is expected to grow, given a more favorable private investment climate          
since 1983. Despite an impressive average annual growth rate for the            
economy of 5.6% during the period 1986-90, unemployment remains high            
at about 25%.
