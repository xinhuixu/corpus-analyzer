Overview: Whereas the northern city Sanaa is the political                      
capital of a united Yemen, the southern city Aden, with its refinery            
and port facilities, is the economic and commercial capital. Future             
economic development depends heavily on Western-assisted development            
of promising oil resources. South Yemen's willingness to merge stemmed          
partly from the steady decline in Soviet economic support.                      
                                                                                
North--The low level of domestic industry and agriculture have made             
northern Yemen dependent on imports for virtually all of its essential          
needs. Large trade deficits have been made up for by remittances from           
Yemenis working abroad and foreign aid. Once self-sufficient in food            
production, northern Yemen has been a major importer. Land once used for        
export crops--cotton, fruit, and vegetables--has been turned over to            
growing qat, a mildly narcotic shrub chewed by Yemenis that has no              
significant export market. Oil export revenues started flowing in late          
1987 and boosted 1988 earnings by about $800 million.                           
                                                                                
South--This has been one of the poorest Arab countries, with a per              
capita GNP of about $500. A shortage of natural resources, a widely             
dispersed population, and an arid climate have made economic development        
difficult. The economy has grown at an average annual rate of only 2-3%         
since the mid-1970s. The economy had been organized along socialist             
lines, dominated by the public sector. Economic growth has been                 
constrained by a lack of incentives, partly stemming from centralized           
control over production decisions, investment allocation, and import            
choices.
