Overview: The economy, dependent on timber and manganese until                  
the early 1970s, is now dominated by the oil sector. During the period          
1981-85 oil accounted for about 46% of GDP, 83% of export earnings, and         
65% of government revenues on average. The high oil prices of the early         
1980s contributed to a substantial increase in per capita income,               
stimulated domestic demand, reinforced migration from rural to urban            
areas, and raised the level of real wages to among the highest in               
Sub-Saharan Africa. The three-year slide of Gabon's economy, which              
began with falling oil prices in 1985, was reversed in 1989 because of a        
near doubling of oil prices over their 1988 lows. In 1990 the economy           
continued to grow, but debt servicing problems are hindering economic           
advancement. The agricultural and industrial sectors are relatively             
underdeveloped, except for oil.
