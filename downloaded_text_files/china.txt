ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been                
trying to move the economy from the sluggish Soviet-style centrally             
planned economy to a more productive and flexible economy with market           
elements--but still within the framework of monolithic Communist control.       
To this end the authorities have switched to a system of household              
responsibility in agriculture in place of the old collectivization,             
increased the authority of local officials and plant managers in                
industry, permitted a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in services        
and light manufacturing, and opened the foreign economic sector to              
increased trade and joint ventures. The most gratifying result has been a       
strong spurt in production, particularly in agriculture in the early            
1980s. Otherwise, the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid            
system the worst results of socialism (bureaucracy, lassitude,                  
corruption) and of capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up inflation).        
Beijing thus has periodically backtracked, retightening central controls        
at intervals and thereby undermining the credibility of the reform              
process. Popular resistance and changes in central policy have                  
weakened China's population control program, which is essential to the          
nation's long-term economic viability.
