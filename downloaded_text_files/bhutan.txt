Overview: The economy, one of the world's least developed,                      
is based on agriculture and forestry, which provide the main livelihood         
for 90% of the population and account for about 50% of GDP. Rugged              
mountains dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other         
infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy is closely                  
aligned with that of India through strong trade and monetary links.             
Low wages in industry lead most Bhutanese to stay in agriculture.               
Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian            
migrant labor. Bhutan's hydropower potential and its attraction for             
tourists are its most important natural resources.
