Overview: Bermuda enjoys one of the highest per capita incomes in               
the world, having successfully exploited its location by providing luxury       
tourist facilities and financial services. The tourist industry attracts        
more than 90% of its business from North America. The industrial sector         
is small, and agriculture is severely limited by a lack of suitable land.       
About 80% of food needs are imported.
