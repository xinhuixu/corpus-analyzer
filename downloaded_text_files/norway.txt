Overview: Norway is a prosperous capitalist nation with the                     
resources to finance extensive welfare measures. Since 1975 exploitation        
of large crude oil and natural gas reserves has helped maintain high            
growth; for the past five years growth has averaged 4.1%, the                   
fourth-highest among OECD countries. Growth slackened in 1987-88                
partially because of the sharp drop in world oil prices, but picked             
up again in 1989. The Brundtland government plans to push hard on               
environmental issues, as well as cutting unemployment, improving                
child care, upgrading major industries, and negotiating an                      
EC - European Free Trade Association (EFTA) agreement on an Economic            
European Area.
