Overview: The economy, destroyed during the regime of former                    
President Macias Nguema, is now based on agriculture, forestry,                 
and fishing, which account for about 60% of GNP and nearly all exports.         
Subsistence agriculture predominates, with cocoa, coffee, and wood              
products providing income, foreign exchange, and government                     
revenues. There is little industry. Commerce accounts                           
for about 10% of GNP, and the construction, public works, and service           
sectors for about 34%. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium,          
iron ore, manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold.  Oil exploration,              
taking place under concessions offered to US, French, and Spanish firms,        
has been moderately successful, and some revenues from oil exports              
will begin rolling in by mid-1991.
