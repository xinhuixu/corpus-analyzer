Overview: Singapore has an open entrepreneurial economy with strong             
service and manufacturing sectors and excellent international trading           
links derived from its entrepot history. During the 1970s and early             
1980s, the economy expanded rapidly, achieving an average annual growth         
rate of 9%. Per capita GDP is among the highest in Asia. In 1985 the            
economy registered its first drop in 20 years and achieved less than a 2%       
increase in 1986. Recovery was strong based on rising demand for                
Singapore's products in OECD countries and improved competitiveness of          
domestic manufactures. The economy grew 8.3% in 1990. Singapore's               
position as a major oil refining and services center helped it weather          
the Persian Gulf crisis.
