Overview: Although possessing many natural resources and                        
considerable potential for agricultural development, Guinea is one of the       
poorest countries in the world. The agricultural sector contributes about       
40% to GDP and employs more than 80% of the work force, while industry          
accounts for 27% of GDP. Guinea possesses over 25% of theworld's                
bauxite reserves; exports of bauxite and alumina accounted for                  
about 70% of total exports in 1989.
