Overview: Agriculture, forestry, and fishing dominate the economy,              
employing about 45% of the labor force and accounting for 26% of                
GDP. The plantation crops of tea, rubber, and coconuts provide about 35%        
of export earnings. The economy has been plagued by high rates of               
unemployment since the late 1970s. Economic growth, which has been              
depressed by ethnic unrest, accelerated in 1990 as domestic conditions          
began to improve.
