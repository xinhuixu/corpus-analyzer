Overview: Significant resources are limestone, a favorable                      
geographic location, and a productive labor force. Malta produces only          
about 20% of its food needs, has limited freshwater supplies, and has no        
domestic energy sources. Consequently, the economy is highly dependent on       
foreign trade and services. Manufacturing and tourism are the largest           
contributors to the economy. Manufacturing accounts for about 27% of GDP,       
with the electronics and textile industries major contributors. In 1989         
inflation was held to a low 0.9%. Per capita GDP at $5,500 places Malta         
in the middle-income range of the world's nations.
