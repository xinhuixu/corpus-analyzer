Overview: One of the poorest countries in the world, Burkina                    
has a high population density, few natural resources, and relatively            
infertile soil. Economic development is hindered by a poor communications       
network within a landlocked country. Agriculture provides about 40% of          
GDP and is entirely of a subsistence nature. Industry, dominated by             
unprofitable government-controlled corporations, accounts for about             
15% of GDP.
