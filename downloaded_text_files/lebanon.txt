Note: Between early 1975 and late 1976 Lebanon was torn by civil                
war between its Christians--then aided by Syrian troops--and its Muslims        
and their Palestinian allies. The cease-fire established in October             
1976 between the domestic political groups generally held for about six         
years, despite occasional fighting. Syrian troops constituted as the Arab       
Deterrent Force by the Arab League have remained in Lebanon. Syria's            
move toward supporting the Lebanese Muslims and the Palestinians and            
Israel's growing support for Lebanese Christians brought the two sides          
into rough equilibrium, but no progress was made toward national                
reconciliation or political reforms--the original cause of the war.             
                                                                                
Continuing Israeli concern about the Palestinian presence in                    
Lebanon led to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982. Israeli            
forces occupied all of the southern portion of the country and mounted a        
summer-long siege of Beirut, which resulted in the evacuation of the            
PLO from Beirut in September under the supervision of a multinational           
force (MNF) made up of US, French, and Italian troops.                          
                                                                                
Within days of the departure of the MNF, Lebanon's newly elected                
president, Bashir Gemayel, was assassinated. In the wake of his death,          
Christian militiamen massacred hundreds of Palestinian refugees in two          
Beirut camps. This prompted the return of the MNF to ease the security          
burden on Lebanon's weak Army and security forces. In late March 1984           
the last MNF units withdrew.                                                    
                                                                                
Lebanese Parliamentarians met in Taif, Saudi Arabia in late 1989                
and concluded a national reconciliation pact that codified a new                
power-sharing formula, specifiying a Christian president but giving             
Muslims more authority. Rene Muawad was subsequently elected president on       
4 November 1989, ending a 13-month period during which Lebanon had no           
president and rival Muslim and Christian governments. Muawad was                
assassinated 17 days later, on 22 November; on 24 November Ilyas Harawi         
was elected to succeed Muawad.                                                  
                                                                                
In October 1990, the chances for ending the 16 year old civil war               
and implementing Ta'if were markedly improved when Syrian and Lebanese          
forces ousted renegade Christian General Awn from his stronghold in East        
Beirut. Awn had defied the legitimate government and established a              
separate mini-state within East Beirut after being appointed acting             
Prime Minister by outgoing President Gemayel in 1988. Awn and his               
supporters feared Ta'if would diminish Christian power in Lebanon               
and increase the influence of Syria.                                            
                                                                                
Since the removal of Awn, the Lebanese Government has reunited the              
capital city and implemented a phased plan to disarm the militias               
and gradually reestablish authority throughout Lebanon. The army has            
deployed from Beirut north along the coast road to Tripoli, southeast           
into the Shuf mountains, and south to the vicinity of Sidon. Many               
militiamen from Christian and Muslim groups have evacuated Beirut               
for their strongholds in the north, south, and east of the country.             
Some heavy weapons possessed by the militias have been turned over to           
the government, which has begun a plan to integrate some militiamen             
into the military and the internal security forces.                             
                                                                                
Lebanon and Syria signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation in              
May 1991. Lebanon continues to be partially occupied by Syrian troops,          
which are deployed in East and West Beirut, its southern suburbs,               
the Bekaa Valley, and throughout northern Lebanon.                              
                                                                                
Iran also maintains a small contingent of revolutionary guards                  
in the Bekaa Valley and South Lebanon to support Lebanese Islamic               
fundamentalist groups.                                                          
                                                                                
Israel withdrew the bulk of its forces from the south in 1985,                  
although it still retains troops in a 10-km-deep security zone north            
of its border with Lebanon. Israel arms and trains the Army of South            
Lebanon (ASL), which also occupies the security zone and is Israel's            
first line of defense against attacks on its northern border.

Overview: Since 1975 civil war has seriously damaged Lebanon's                  
economic infrastructure, disrupted economic activity, and all but ended         
Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub.                
Following October 1990, however, a tentative peace has enabled the              
central government to begin restoring control in Beirut, collect taxes,         
and regain access to key port and government facilities. The battered           
economy has also been propped up by a financially sound banking system          
and resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers. Family remittances,        
foreign financial support to political factions, the narcotics trade, and       
international emergency aid are main sources of foreign exchange.               
Economic prospects for 1991 have brightened, particularly if the                
Syrian-backed government is able to maintain law and order and                  
reestablish business confidence. Rebuilding war-ravaged Beirut is likely        
to provide a major stimulus to the Lebanese economy in 1991.
