Overview: In 1990 economic growth slowed from an average of 6.2%                
for the previous six years to about 1.5% as a result of tight monetary          
policy aimed at reducing inflation. Monetary policy was not                     
successful at slowing price increases until the end of the year,                
however, and inflation, stimulated by higher world oil prices,                  
increased to 27.3% in 1990 from 21.4% in 1989. Copper prices held strong        
in 1990, helping to maintain a balance-of-payments surplus and increase         
international reserves. Most observers expect that inflationary                 
pressures have run their course and price increases will slow during            
1991, contributing to growth of 4-5%.
