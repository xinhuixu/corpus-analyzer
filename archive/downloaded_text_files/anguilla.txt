Overview: Anguilla has few natural resources, and the economy                   
depends heavily on lobster fishing, offshore banking, tourism, and              
remittances from emigrants. In recent years the economy has benefited           
from a boom in tourism. Development is planned to improve the                   
infrastructure, particularly transport and tourist facilities, and              
also light industry. Improvement in the economy has reduced                     
unemployment from 40% in 1984 to about 5% in 1988.
