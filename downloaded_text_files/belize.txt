ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: The economy is based primarily on agriculture and                     
merchandising. Agriculture accounts for more than 30% of GDP and provides       
75% of export earnings, while sugar, the chief crop, accounts for almost        
40% of hard currency earnings. The US, Belize's main trading partner, is        
assisting in efforts to reduce dependency on sugar with an agricultural         
diversification program.
