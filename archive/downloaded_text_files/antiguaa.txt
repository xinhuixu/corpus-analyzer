ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: The economy is primarily service oriented, with tourism               
the most important determinant of economic performance. During the period       
1983-89, real GDP expanded at an annual average rate of about 7%.               
Tourism's contribution to GDP, as measured by value added tax in hotels         
and restaurants, rose from about 14% in 1983 to 16% in 1989, and                
stimulated growth in other sectors--particularly in construction,               
communications, and public utilities. Antigua and Barbuda is one of the         
few areas in the Caribbean experiencing a labor shortage in some sectors        
of the economy.
