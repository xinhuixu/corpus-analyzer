Overview: The economy is based on fishing, tourism, and shipping.               
Agriculture is limited to the production of a few subsistence crops that        
provide only 10% of food requirements. Fishing is the largest industry,         
employing 25% of the work force and accounting for over 60% of exports;         
it is also an important source of government revenue. During the 1980s          
tourism has become one of the most important and highest growth sectors         
of the economy. In 1988 industry accounted for about 5% of GDP. Real            
GDP is officially estimated to have increased by about 10% annually             
during the period 1974-87, and GDP estimates for 1988 show a further            
growth of 9% on the strength of a record fish catch and an improved             
tourist season.
