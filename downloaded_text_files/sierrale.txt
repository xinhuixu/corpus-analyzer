Overview: The economic and social infrastructure is not well                    
developed. Subsistence agriculture dominates the economy, generating            
about one-third of GDP and employing about two-thirds of the working            
population. Manufacturing accounts for less than 10% of GDP, consisting         
mainly of the processing of raw materials and of light manufacturing for        
the domestic market. Diamond mining provides an important source of hard        
currency. The economy suffers from high unemployment, rising inflation,
