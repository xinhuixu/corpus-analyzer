ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: The economy, centrally planned and largely state owned,               
is highly dependent on the agricultural sector and foreign trade. Sugar         
provides about 75% of export revenues and over half is exported to the          
USSR. The economy has stagnated since 1985 under policies that have             
deemphasized material incentives in the workplace, abolished farmers'           
informal produce markets, and raised prices of government-supplied goods        
and services. In 1990 the economy probably fell 3%, largely as a result         
of declining trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Recently           
the government has been trying to increase trade with Latin America and         
China. Cuba has had difficulty servicing its foreign debt since 1982. The       
government currently is encouraging foreign investment in tourist               
facilities. Other investment priorities include sugar, basic foods, and         
nickel. The annual $4 billion Soviet subsidy, a main prop to Cuba's             
threadbare economy, is likely to show a substantial decline over the            
next few years in view of the USSR's mounting economic problems. Instead        
of highly subsidized trade, Cuba will be shifting to trade at market            
prices in convertible currencies. In early 1991, the shortages of fuels,        
spare parts, and industrial products in general had become so severe as         
to amount to a deindustrialization process in the eyes of some observers.
