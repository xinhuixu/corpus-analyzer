Overview: The Bahamas is a stable, middle-income developing nation              
whose economy is based primarily on tourism and offshore banking. Tourism       
alone provides about 50% of GDP and directly or indirectly employs about        
50,000 people or 40% of the local work force. The economy has slackened         
in recent years, as the annual increase in the number of tourists slowed.       
Nonetheless, the per capita GDP of $9,800 is one of the highest in the          
region.
