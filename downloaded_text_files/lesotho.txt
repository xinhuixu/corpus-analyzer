Overview: Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no                    
important natural resources other than water. Its economy is based on           
agriculture, light manufacturing, and remittances from laborers employed        
in South Africa ($153 million in 1989). The great majority of households        
gain their livelihoods from subsistence farming and migrant labor.              
Manufacturing depends largely on farm products to support the milling,          
canning, leather, and jute industries; other industries include textile,        
clothing, and light engineering. Industry's share of GDP rose from              
6% in 1982 to 15% in 1989. Political and economic instability in South          
Africa raise uncertainties for Lesotho's economy, especially with respect       
to migrant worker remittances--over one-third of GDP.
