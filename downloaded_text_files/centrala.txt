Overview: The Central African Republic (CAR) had a per capita                   
income of roughly $440 in 1990. Subsistence agriculture, including              
forestry, is the backbone of the economy, with over 70% of the population       
living in the countryside. In 1988 the agricultural sector generated            
about 40% of GDP. Agricultural products accounted for about 60% of export       
earnings and the diamond industry for 30%. Important constraints to             
economic development include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor              
transportation infrastructure, and a weak human resource base.                  
Multilateral and bilateral development assistance plays a major role in         
providing capital for new investment.
