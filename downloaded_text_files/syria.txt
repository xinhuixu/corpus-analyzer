Overview: Syria's rigidly structured Bathist economy turned                     
out slightly more goods in 1990 than in 1983, when the population was 20%       
smaller. Economic difficulties are attributable, in part, to severe             
drought in several recent years, costly but unsuccessful attempts               
to match Israel's military strength, a falloff in Arab aid, and                 
insufficient foreign exchange earnings to buy needed inputs for industry        
and agriculture. Socialist policy, embodied in a thicket of bureaucratic        
regulations, in many instances has driven away or pushed underground the        
mercantile and entrepreneurial spirit for which Syrian businessmen have         
long been famous. Two bright spots: a sizable number of villagers have          
benefited from land redistribution, electrification, and other rural            
development programs; and a recent find of light crude oil has enabled          
Syria to cut oil imports. A long-term concern is the additional drain of        
upstream Euphrates water by Turkey when its vast dam and irrigation             
projects are completed toward the end of the 1990s. Output in 1990              
rebounded from the very bad year of 1989, as agricultural production            
and oil revenues increased substantially.
