Overview: Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich                        
agricultural areas.  Growth has been uneven because of natural disasters        
(e.g., a major earthquake in 1987), fluctuations in global oil prices,          
and government policies designed to curb inflation.  The government has         
not taken a supportive attitude toward either domestic or foreign               
investment, although its agreement to enter the Andean free trade zone          
is an encouraging move.
