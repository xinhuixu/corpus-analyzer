ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: This small private-enterprise economy has capitalized                 
on its central geographic location, highly developed transport                  
network, and diversified industrial and commercial base. Industry is            
concentrated mainly in the populous Flemish area in the north, although         
the government is encouraging reinvestment in the southern region               
of Walloon. With few natural resources Belgium must import essential raw        
materials, making its economy closely dependent on the state of world           
markets. Over 70% of trade is with other EC countries. During                   
the period 1988-90 Belgium's economic performance was marked by buoyant         
output growth, moderate inflation, and a substantial external surplus.          
Real GDP grew by an average of 3.9% in 1988-90. However, the economy            
is likely to slow in 1991-92 to below 3% GDP growth.
