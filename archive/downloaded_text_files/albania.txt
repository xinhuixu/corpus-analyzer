Overview: As the poorest country in Europe, Albania's development               
lags behind even the least favored areas of the Yugoslav economy.               
For over 40 years, the Stalinist-type economy has operated on the               
principles of central planning and state ownership of the means of              
production. In recent years Albania has implemented limited economic            
reforms to stimulate its lagging economy, provide incentives, and               
decentralize decisionmaking. In an effort to expand international               
ties, Tirane has reestablished diplomatic relations with the Soviet             
Union and the US. The Albanians have also passed legislation allowing           
foreign investment. Albania possesses considerable mineral                      
resources and, until 1990, was largely self-sufficient in food;                 
several years of drought have hindered agricultural development.                
Numerical estimates of Albanian economic activity are subject to an             
especially wide margin of error because the government until recently           
did not release economic information.
