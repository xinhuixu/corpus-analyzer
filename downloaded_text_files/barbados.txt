ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: A per capita income of $6,500 gives Barbados one of                   
the highest standards of living of all the small island states of the           
eastern Caribbean. Historically, the economy was based on the cultivation       
of sugarcane and related activities. In recent years, however, the              
economy has diversified into manufacturing and tourism. The tourist             
industry is now a major employer of the labor force and a primary source        
of foreign exchange. An unemployment rate of 18% remains one of the most        
serious economic problems facing the country.
