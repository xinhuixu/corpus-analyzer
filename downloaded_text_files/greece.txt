Overview: Greece has a mixed capitalistic economy with the basic                
entrepreneurial system overlaid in 1981-89 by a socialist government            
that enlarged the public sector from 55% of GDP in 1981 to about 70%            
when Prime Minister Mitsotakis took office. Mitsotakis inherited several        
severe economic problems from the preceding socialist and caretaker             
governments, which neglected the runaway budget deficit, a ballooning           
current account deficit, and accelerating inflation. With only a                
two-seat majority in the Chamber of Deputies, Mitsotakis has concentrated       
on cutting the public-sector payroll, cautiously expanding the tax base,        
and adopting guidelines for privatizing Greece's loss-ridden state-owned        
enterprises. Once the political situation is sorted out, Greece will have       
to face the challenges posed by the steadily increasing integration of          
the European Community, including the progressive lowering of trade and         
investment barriers. Tourism continues as a major industry, providing a         
vital offset to the sizable commodity trade deficit.
