ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: The Faroese, who have long been enjoying the affluent                 
living standards of the Danes and other Scandinavians,                          
now must cope with the decline of the all-important fishing                     
industry and with an external debt twice the size of annual                     
income. When the nations of the world extended their fishing                    
zones to 200 nautical miles in the early 1970s, the Faroese                     
no longer could continue their traditional long-distance fishing                
and subsequently depleted their own nearby fishing areas; one                   
estimate foresaw a 25% drop in fish catch in 1990 alone. Half the               
fishing fleet is for sale, and the 22 fish-processing plants work               
at only half capacity. The government no longer can maintain its                
high level of spending on roads and tunnels, hospitals, sports                  
facilities, and other social welfare programs.
