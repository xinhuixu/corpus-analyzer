ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: One of the world's most developed economies, France                   
has substantial agricultural resources and a highly diversified modern          
industrial sector. Large tracts of fertile land, the application of             
modern technology, and subsidies have combined to make it the leading           
agricultural producer in Western Europe. France is largely                      
self-sufficient in agricultural products and is a major exporter of             
wheat and dairy products. The industrial sector generates about                 
one-quarter of GDP, and the growing services sector has become crucial          
to the economy. After sluggish growth during the period 1982-87, the            
economy expanded at a rapid 3.8% pace in 1988-89. The economy                   
slowed down in 1990, with growth of 2.0% expected in 1991.                      
The economy has had difficulty generating enough jobs for new                   
entrants into the labor force, resulting in a high unemployment rate,           
which probably will rise to around 10% during the slowdown.                     
The steadily advancing economic integration within the European                 
Community is a major force affecting the fortunes of the various economic       
sectors.
