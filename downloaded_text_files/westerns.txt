Overview: Agriculture employs more than half of the labor force,                
contributes 50% to GDP, and furnishes 90% of exports. The bulk                  
of export earnings comes from the sale of coconut oil and copra. The            
economy depends on emigrant remittances and foreign aid to support a            
level of imports about five times export earnings. Tourism has become the       
most important growth industry, and construction of the first                   
international hotel is under way.
