Overview: Fundamentally, Afghanistan is an extremely poor,                      
landlocked country, highly dependent on farming (wheat especially) and          
livestock raising (sheep and goats). Economic considerations, however,          
have played second fiddle to political and military upheavals, including        
the nine-year Soviet military occupation (ended 15 February 1989) and the       
continuing bloody civil war. Over the past decade, one-third of the             
population has fled the country, with Pakistan sheltering about 3.3             
million refugees and Iran about 1.3 million. Another 1 million have             
probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan. Large            
numbers of bridges, buildings, and factories have been destroyed or             
damaged by military action or sabotage. Government claims                       
to the contrary, gross domestic product almost certainly is                     
lower than 10 years ago because of the loss of labor and capital                
and the disruption of trade and transport.
