Overview: The economy has historically been based on cattle raising             
and crops. Agriculture today provides a livelihood for over 80% of the          
population, but produces only about 50% of food needs and contributes           
a small 3% to GDP. The driving force behind the rapid economic growth of        
the 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry. This sector, mostly on        
the strength of diamonds, has gone from generating 25% of GDP in 1980 to        
over 50% in 1989. No other sector has experienced such growth, especially       
not agriculture, which is plagued by erratic rainfall and poor soils. The       
unemployment rate remains a problem at 25%.
