Overview: The economy is slowly recovering from the deep recession              
of the early 1980s. In 1988 real GDP grew by only 0.5% and in 1989 by           
1.5%. The recovery was led by growth in the agriculture and fishing             
sectors, agriculture alone contributing 20% to GDP, employing about 11%         
of the labor force, and generating a large proportion of export earnings.       
Raising livestock, particularly cattle and sheep, is the major                  
agricultural activity. In 1990, despite healthy exports and an improved         
current account, domestic growth remained weak because of government            
concentration on the external sector, adverse weather conditions, and           
prolonged strikes. Bringing down high inflation, reducing a large fiscal        
deficit, and avoiding frequent strikes remain major economic problems           
for the government.
