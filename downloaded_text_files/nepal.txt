ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries              
in the world with a per capita income of less than $200. Real growth            
averaged 4% in the 1980s until FY89, when it plunged to 1.5% because of         
a trade/transit dispute with India. Though the impasse is over,                 
political turmoil and inflated energy costs will probably constrain             
growth to under 4%. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy,                 
providing a livelihood for over 90% of the population and                       
accounting for 60% of GDP. Industrial activity is limited, mainly               
involving the processing of agricultural produce (jute, sugarcane,              
tobacco, and grain). Production of textiles and carpets has expanded            
recently and accounted for 87% of foreign exchange earnings in FY89.            
Apart from agricultural land and forests, the only other exploitable            
natural resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural               
production in the late 1980s grew by about 5%, compared                         
with a population growth of 2.6%. Forty percent or more of the                  
population is undernourished partly because of poor distribution.               
Economic prospects for the 1990s are poor, with economic growth                 
probably outpacing population growth only slightly.
