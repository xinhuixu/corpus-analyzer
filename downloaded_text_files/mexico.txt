Overview: Mexico's economy is a mixture of state-owned industrial               
plants (notably oil), private manufacturing and services, and both              
large-scale and traditional agriculture. In the 1980s Mexico experienced        
severe economic difficulties: the nation accumulated large external debts       
as world petroleum prices fell; rapid population growth outstripped the         
domestic food supply; and inflation, unemployment, and pressures to             
emigrate became more acute. Growth in national output, however,                 
appears to be recovering, rising from 1.4% in 1988 to 3.9% in 1990.             
The US is Mexico's major trading partner, accounting for two-thirds of          
its exports and imports. After petroleum, border assembly plants and            
tourism are the largest earners of foreign exchange. The government, in         
consultation with international economic agencies, is implementing              
programs to stabilize the economy and foster growth. In 1991 the                
government also plans to begin negotiations with the US and Canada on a         
free trade agreement.
