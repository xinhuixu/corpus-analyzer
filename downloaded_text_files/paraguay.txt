ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: The economy is predominantly agricultural. Agriculture,               
including forestry, accounts for about 25% of GNP, employs about 45% of         
the labor force, and provides the bulk of exports. Paraguay has no known        
significant mineral or petroleum resources but does have a large                
hydropower potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined              
compared with the boom period of 1976-81, when real GDP grew at an              
average annual rate of nearly 11%.  During 1982-86 real GDP fell in three       
of five years, inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32%, and                   
foreign debt rose. Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the          
economy were the completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather        
for crops, and weak international commodity prices for agricultural             
exports. In 1987 the economy experienced a minor recovery because of            
improved weather conditions and stronger international prices for key           
agricultural exports. The recovery continued through 1990, on the               
strength of bumper crops in 1988-89. The government, however, must              
follow through on promises of reforms needed to deal with escalating            
inflation, large fiscal deficits, growing debt arrearages, and falling          
reserves.
