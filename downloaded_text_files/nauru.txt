of which are expected to be exhausted by the year 2000. Phosphates have         
given Nauruans one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third               
World--$10,000 annually. Few other resources exist so                           
most necessities must be imported, including fresh water from                   
Australia. The rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of income       
from phosphates constitute serious long-term problems. Substantial              
investment in trust funds, out of phosphate income, will help cushion the       
transition.
