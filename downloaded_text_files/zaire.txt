Overview: In 1990, in spite of large mineral resources and one                  
of the most developed and diversified economies in Sub-Saharan Africa,          
Zaire had a GDP per capita of only about $200, one of the lowest on the         
continent. The country's chronic economic problems worsened in 1990,            
with copper production down 20% to a 20-year low, inflation near                
250% compared with 100% in 1987-89, and IMF and most World Bank support         
suspended until the institution of agreed-on changes. Agriculture, a key        
sector of the economy, employs 75% of the population but generates              
under 25% of GDP. The main potential for economic development has been          
the extractive industries. Mining and mineral processing account for            
about one-third of GDP and two-thirds of total export earnings.                 
Zaire is the world's largest producer of diamonds.                              
                                                                                
GDP: $6.6 billion, per capita $180; real growth rate - 2% (1990
