Student 1   So, it's like...
            00:03:36.800 - 00:03:39.000
Student 2   Comparing holidays?
            00:03:39.210 - 00:03:40.987
Teacher 1   Exactly, comparing holidays using the simple past tense
            00:03:41.000 - 00:03:45.300
Student 3   And tell why it was different?
            00:03:45.500 - 00:03:47.260
Teacher 1   Yes, focus on the reasons for the differences
            00:03:47.500 - 00:03:51.654
Student 4   Can it be any holiday?
            00:03:52.010 - 00:03:53.487
Teacher 1   Any holiday or festival that you have experienced
            00:03:53.690 - 00:03:57.021
Student 5   What if I don't celebrate much?
            00:03:57.230 - 00:03:59.999
Teacher 1   Think of any special day or event, doesn't have to be a major holiday
            00:04:00.210 - 00:04:04.412
Student 6   Got it, so we're practicing narrative skills too?
            00:04:04.620 - 00:04:06.498
Teacher 1   Precisely, storytelling and using the past tense effectively
            00:04:06.700 - 00:04:10.123
Student 1   And we have to make a PowerPoint?
            00:04:10.330 - 00:04:12.070
Teacher 1   Yes, a short presentation to share with the class
            00:04:12.280 - 00:04:15.654
Student 2   How many slides?
            00:04:15.860 - 00:04:17.430
Teacher 1   Three to five slides should be enough
            00:04:17.640 - 00:04:21.012
Student 3   What about pictures?
            00:04:21.220 - 00:04:23.100
Teacher 1   If you have pictures, great! They make your story more engaging
            00:04:23.310 - 00:04:26.789
Student 4   And we present this Friday?
            00:04:26.990 - 00:04:28.470
Teacher 1   Yes, we'll start with presentations on Friday
            00:04:28.680 - 00:04:32.100
Student 5   Is there a time limit?
            00:04:32.310 - 00:04:34.213
Teacher 1   Try to keep it under 5 minutes
            00:04:34.420 - 00:04:38.500
Student 6   Can we work in pairs?
            00:04:38.710 - 00:04:40.289
Teacher 1   For this assignment, I'd like everyone to work individually
            00:04:40.500 - 00:04:44.000
Student 1   What if we're nervous speaking in front?
            00:04:44.210 - 00:04:46.987
Teacher 1   Practice makes perfect. This is a safe space to practice and improve
            00:04:47.200 - 00:04:51.600
Student 2   Ok, I think I have an idea already
            00:04:51.810 - 00:04:53.630
Teacher 1   Great! I'm excited to see what you all come up with
            00:04:53.840 - 00:04:57.321
Student 3   Me too, I have a unique holiday experience
            00:04:57.530 - 00:04:59.410
Teacher 1   That's the spirit! Unique stories make for memorable presentations
            00:04:59.620 - 00:05:03.987
Student 4   I'll need to dig up some old photos then
            00:05:04.200 - 00:05:06.378
Teacher 1   Old photos are perfect. They add a personal touch
            00:05:06.580 - 00:05:10.
