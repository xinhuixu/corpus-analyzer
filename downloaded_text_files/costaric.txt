ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: In 1990 the economy grew at an estimated 3.5%                         
rate, a decrease from the strong 5.0% gain of the previous year.                
Gains in agricultural production (on the strength of good coffee and            
banana crops) and in construction, were partially offset by lower               
rates of growth for industry. In 1990 consumer prices rose by about 25%         
and the trade deficit widened. Unemployment is officially reported at           
6%, but much underemployment remains. External debt, on a per                   
capita basis, is among the world's highest.
