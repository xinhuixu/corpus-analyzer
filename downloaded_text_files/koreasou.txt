Overview: The driving force behind the economy's dynamic growth                 
has been the planned development of an export-oriented economy in a             
vigorously entrepreneurial society. Real GNP--which grew by 6.7% in 1989        
after an average annual growth of over 12% between 1986-88--grew about          
9% in 1990. Labor unrest--which led to substantial wage hikes in                
1987-88--was noticeably calmer in 1990, unemployment averaged a low             
2.5%, and investment was strong. Inflation rates, however, are beginning        
to challenge South Korea's strong economic performance. Consumer prices         
rose 8.6%, the highest rate in nine years. Policymakers are concerned           
higher prices could lead to a resurgence of labor unrest.
