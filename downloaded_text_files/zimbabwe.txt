Overview: Agriculture employs three-fourths of the labor force and              
supplies almost 40% of exports. The manufacturing sector, based on              
agriculture and mining, produces a variety of goods and contributes 35%         
to GDP. Mining accounts for only 5% of both GDP and employment, but             
supplies of minerals and metals account for about 40% of exports. Wide          
year-to-year fluctuations in agricultural production over the past six          
years have resulted in an uneven growth rate, one that on average matched       
the 3% annual increase in population.
