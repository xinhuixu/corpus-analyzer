Overview: The economy is based on US military spending and on                   
revenues from tourism. Over the past 20 years the tourist industry has          
grown rapidly, creating a construction boom for new hotels and the              
expansion of older ones. Visitors numbered about 900,000 in 1990. The           
small manufacturing sector includes textile and clothing, beverage, food,       
and watch production. About 60% of the labor force works for the private        
sector and the rest for government. Most food and industrial goods are          
imported, with about 75% from the US. In 1990 the unemployment rate was         
about 2%, down from 10% in 1983.
