Overview: Burma is a poor Asian country, with a per capita GDP                  
of about $400. The nation has been unable to achieve any substantial            
improvement in export earnings because of falling prices for many               
of its major commodity exports. For rice, traditionally the most                
important export, the drop in world prices has been accompanied by              
shrinking markets and a smaller volume of sales. In 1985 teak replaced          
rice as the largest export and continues to hold this position. The             
economy is heavily dependent on the agricultural sector, which generates        
about half of GDP and provides employment for 66% of the work force.
