Overview: Oil is the backbone of the economy and accounts for more              
than 85% of export earnings and roughly 75% of government revenues.             
Proved oil reserves of 3.3 billion barrels should ensure continued output       
at current levels for about 25 years. Oil has given Qatar a per capita          
GDP of about $12,500, among the highest in the world outside the OECD
