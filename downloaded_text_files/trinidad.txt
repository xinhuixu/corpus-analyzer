Overview: Trinidad and Tobago's petroleum-based economy began to                
emerge from a lengthy depression in 1990. The economy fell sharply              
through most of the 1980s, largely because of the decline in oil prices.        
This sector accounts for 80% of export earnings and more than 25% of            
GDP. The government, in response to the oil revenue loss, pursued a             
series of austerity measures that pushed the unemployment rate as high          
as 22% in 1988. The economy showed signs of recovery in 1990, however,          
helped along by rising oil prices. Agriculture employs only about 11% of        
the labor force and produces about 3% of GDP. Since this sector is              
small, it has been unable to absorb the large numbers of the unemployed.        
The government currently seeks to diversify its export base.
