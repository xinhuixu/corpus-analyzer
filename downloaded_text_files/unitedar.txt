Overview: The UAE has an open economy with one of the world's                   
highest incomes per capita outside the OECD nations. This wealth is based       
on oil and gas, and the fortunes of the economy fluctuate with the prices       
of those commodities. Since 1973, when petroleum prices shot up, the UAE        
has undergone a profound transformation from an impoverished region of          
small desert principalities to a modern state with a high standard of           
living. At present levels of production, crude oil reserves should last         
for over 100 years.
