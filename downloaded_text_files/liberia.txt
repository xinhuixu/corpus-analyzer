Overview: Civil war during 1990 destroyed much of Liberia's                     
economy, especially the infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Expatriate       
businessmen fled the country, taking capital and expertise with them.           
Many will not return. Richly endowed with water, mineral resources,             
forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture, Liberia had been a             
producer and exporter of basic products, while local manufacturing,             
mainly foreign owned, had been small in scope. Political instability            
threatens prospects for economic reconstruction and repatriation of             
some 750,000 Liberian refugees who fled to neighboring countries.
