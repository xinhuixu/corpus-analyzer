ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: Over the past 25 years, the economy has changed from                  
one based on subsistence whaling, hunting, and fishing to one dependent         
on foreign trade. Fishing is still the most important industry,                 
accounting for over 75% of exports and about 25% of the                         
population's income. Maintenance of a social welfare system similar to          
Denmark's has given the public sector a dominant role in the economy.           
In 1990, the economy became critically dependent on shrimp exports and an       
annual subsidy (now about $355 million) from the Danish Government              
because cod exports had fallen, the zinc and lead mine closed, and              
a large promising platinum and gold mine was not yet operational.               
Greenland has signed a contract for its largest construction project,           
a power plant to supply the capital. To avoid a decline in the economy,         
Denmark has agreed to pay 75% of the costs of running Sondrestrom               
Airbase and Kulusuk Airfield as civilian bases after the US withdraws           
in 1992.
