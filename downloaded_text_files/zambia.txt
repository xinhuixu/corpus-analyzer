Overview: The economy has been in decline for more than a decade                
with falling imports and growing foreign debt. Economic difficulties            
stem from a sustained drop in copper production and ineffective economic        
policies. In 1990 real GDP stood only slightly higher than that of 10           
years before, while an annual population growth of more than 3% has             
brought a decline in per capita GDP of 25% during the same period. A            
high inflation rate has also added to Zambia's economic woes in recent          
years.
