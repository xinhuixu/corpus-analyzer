Overview: Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world.                
The economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about       
47% of GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work force.         
Industry accounts for 8% of GDP and is mainly limited to processing             
agricultural products and light consumer goods. The economic                    
recovery program announced in mid-1986 has generated notable increases in       
agricultural production and financial support for the program by                
bilateral donors. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have       
increased the availability of imports and provided funds to rehabilitate        
Tanzania's deteriorated economic infrastructure.
