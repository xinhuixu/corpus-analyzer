ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: The economy is based on service activities connected with             
the country's strategic location and status as a free trade zone in             
northeast Africa. Djibouti provides services as both a transit port             
for the region and an international transshipment and refueling center.         
It has few natural resources and little industry. The nation is,                
therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help support its          
balance of payments and to finance development projects. An unemployment        
rate of over 40% continues to be a major problem. Per capita                    
consumption dropped an estimated 35% over the last five years with              
a population growth rate of 6% (including immigrants and refugees) and a        
recession.
