Overview: In 1990 the world economy grew at an estimated 1.0%,                  
considerably lower than the estimated 3.0% for 1989 and the 3.4% for            
1988. The technologically advanced areas--North America, Japan, and             
Western Europe--together account for 67% of the gross world product (GWP)       
of $20.9 trillion; these developed areas grew in the aggregate at 2.3%          
in 1990. In contrast, output in the USSR and Eastern Europe fell an             
average of 5.2%; these countries account for 15% of GWP. Experience             
in the developing countries continued mixed, with the newly                     
industrializing economies generally maintaining their rapid growth,             
and many others struggling with debt, rampant inflation, and inadequate         
investment. This third group contributed 18% of GWP and grew on                 
average 2.3% in 1990; output in this group is probably understated              
because of lack of data and the method of calculation used. The year 1990       
witnessed continued political and economic upheavals in the USSR and            
Eastern Europe, which are in between systems, lacking both the rough            
discipline of the command economy and the institutions of the market            
economy. As for prospects in the 1990s, the addition of nearly 100              
million people a year to an already overcrowded globe will exacerbate the       
problems of pollution, desertification, underemployment, epidemics,             
and famine.
