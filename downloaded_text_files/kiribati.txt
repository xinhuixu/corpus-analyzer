Overview: The country has few national resources. Commercially                  
viable phosphate deposits were exhausted at the time of independence            
in 1979. Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports.       
The economy has fluctuated widely in recent years. Real GDP declined            
about 8% in 1987, as the fish catch fell sharply to only one-fourth the         
level of 1986 and copra production was hampered by repeated rains. Output       
rebounded strongly in 1988, with real GDP growing by 17%. The upturn in         
economic growth came from an increase in copra production and a good fish       
catch. Following the strong surge in output in 1988, GNP increased 1%
