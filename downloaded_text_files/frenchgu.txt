Overview: The economy is tied closely to that of France through                 
subsidies and imports. Besides the French space center at Kourou, fishing       
and forestry are the most important economic activities, with exports           
of fish and fish products (mostly shrimp) accounting for more than 60%          
of total revenue in 1987. The large reserves of tropical hardwoods, not         
fully exploited, support an expanding sawmill industry that provides sawn       
logs for export. Cultivation of crops--rice, cassava, bananas, and              
sugarcane--are limited to the coastal area, where the population is             
largely concentrated. French Guiana is heavily dependent on imports             
of food and energy. Unemployment is a serious problem, particularly             
among younger workers.
