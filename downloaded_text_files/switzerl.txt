Overview: Switzerland's economic success is matched in few, if any,             
other nations. Per capita output, general living standards, education           
and science, health care, and diet are unsurpassed in Europe. Inflation         
remains low because of sound government policy and harmonious                   
labor-management relations. Unemployment is negligible, a marked                
contrast to the larger economies of Western Europe. This economic               
stability helps promote the important banking and tourist sectors. Since        
World War II, Switzerland's economy has adjusted smoothly to the great          
changes in output and trade patterns in Europe and presumably can adjust        
to the challenges of the 1990s, in particular, the further economic             
integration of Western Europe and the amazingly rapid changes in East           
European political/economic prospects.
