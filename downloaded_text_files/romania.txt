Overview: Industry, which accounts for one-third of the labor force             
and generates over half the GNP, suffers from an aging capital plant and        
persistent shortages of energy. The year 1990 witnessed about a 20%             
drop in industrial production because of energy and input shortages and         
labor unrest. In recent years the agricultural sector has had to contend        
with drought, mismanagement, and shortages of inputs. A drought in 1990         
contributed to a lackluster harvest, a problem compounded by corruption         
and a poor distribution system. The new government is slowly loosening          
the tight central controls of Ceaucesescu's command economy. It has             
instituted moderate land reforms, with close to one-half of cropland now        
in private hands, and it has allowed changes in prices for private              
agricultural output. Also, the new regime is permitting the                     
establishment of private enterprises, largely in services, handicrafts,         
and small-scale industry. New laws providing for the privatization              
of large state firms have been passed. However, most of the early               
privatization will involve converting state firms into joint-stock              
companies. The selling of shares to the public has not yet been worked          
out. Furthermore, the government has halted the old policy of diverting         
food from domestic consumption to hard currency export markets. So far,         
the government does not seem willing to adopt a thoroughgoing market            
system, that is, there is great caution in decontrolling prices because         
of public opposition. The government has sharply raised price ceilings          
instead of lifting them entirely.
