ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: Iceland's prosperous Scandinavian-type economy is                     
basically capitalistic, but with extensive welfare measures, low                
unemployment, and comparatively even distribution of income. The economy        
is heavily dependent on the fishing industry, which provides nearly 75%         
of export earnings. In the absence of other natural resources, Iceland's        
economy is vulnerable to changing world fish prices. As a result of             
climbing fish prices in 1990 and a noninflationary labor agreement,             
Iceland is pulling out of a recession, which began in mid-1988 with a           
sharp decline in fish prices and an imposition of quotas on fish catches        
to conserve stocks. Inflation was down sharply from 20% in 1989                 
to 8% in 1990.
