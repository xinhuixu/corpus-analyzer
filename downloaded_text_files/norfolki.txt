Overview: The primary economic activity is tourism, which has                   
brought a level of prosperity unusual among inhabitants of the Pacific          
Islands. The number of visitors has increased steadily over the years and       
reached 29,000 in FY89. Revenues from tourism have given the                    
island a favorable balance of trade and helped the agricultural sector to       
become self-sufficient in the production of beef, poultry, and eggs.
