Student 1   So, it's like saying 'brother' in English?
            00:00:10.500 - 00:00:12.300
Teacher 1   Exactly, but in our target language, the word carries more cultural significance.
            00:00:12.310 - 00:00:16.789
Student 2   How do you say 'sister' then?
            00:00:17.000 - 00:00:18.500
Teacher 1   It's similar but with a slight variation at the end. Notice how the familial terms reflect respect.
            00:00:18.510 - 00:00:22.230
Student 3   And for 'mother' and 'father'?
            00:00:22.240 - 00:00:23.670
Teacher 1   Those are fundamental words. Here's how you pronounce them...
            00:00:23.680 - 00:00:27.400
            (0.5)
Student 4   I noticed a pattern in the pronunciation. Is it common in family terms?
            00:00:27.900 - 00:00:30.159
Teacher 1   Very observant! Yes, it's a linguistic feature that emphasizes the family unit.
            00:00:30.170 - 00:00:33.980

Student 1   What about 'grandparents'?
            00:00:34.230 - 00:00:35.987
Teacher 1   Oh, that's an interesting one. The term actually differs based on maternal or paternal lineage.
            00:00:35.998 - 00:00:40.012
Student 2   Is there a generic term for cousins, or is it gender-specific?
            00:00:40.220 - 00:00:42.679
Teacher 1   It's gender-specific. Here are both terms...
            00:00:42.690 - 00:00:46.730
            (1.0)
Teacher 1   Now, I'd like you to form sentences using the family terms we've learned.
            00:00:47.730 - 00:00:52.214
Student 3   My brother and I visited our grandparents last summer.
            00:00:52.224 - 00:00:55.639
Teacher 1   Excellent! And can you try using the term for 'sister'?
            00:00:55.650 - 00:00:59.870
Student 4   My sister and I have different hobbies.
            00:00:59.880 - 00:01:03.097
Teacher 1   Perfect. Notice how family terms can easily integrate into your sentences.
            00:01:03.107 - 00:01:07.623
            (0.3)
Teacher 1   For homework, I want you to write a short paragraph about your family using the new vocabulary.
            00:01:07.933 - 00:01:12.456
Teacher 1   This will help reinforce today's lesson and give you practice with the grammatical structures.
            00:01:12.466 - 00:01:16.789
Student 1   Can we include pets?
            00:01:16.800 - 00:01:18.299
Teacher 1   Yes, pets are considered part of the family in many cultures, so let's include them!
            00:01:18.310 - 00:01:22.000
