Overview: GDP expanded by an estimated 5% in 1990, after                        
contracting 1% in 1988 and 14% in 1989. Political stability prompted            
greater business confidence and consumer demand, leading to increased           
production by the agricultural, commercial, manufacturing, construction,        
and utilities sectors. The transportation sector and government services        
declined slightly due to slack early-1990 transits through the Panama           
Canal, lower oil pipeline flowthrough, and Panama City's budget cuts.           
Imports and exports posted gains during the year, and government revenues       
were up sharply over 1989's levels.
