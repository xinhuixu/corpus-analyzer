Overview: The economy is based on sugar, manufacturing (mainly                  
textiles), and tourism. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the cultivated       
land area and accounts for 32% of export earnings. The government's             
development strategy is centered on industrialization (with a view to           
exports), agricultural diversification, and tourism. Economic performance       
in 1989 was impressive, with 5.0% real growth and low unemployment.
