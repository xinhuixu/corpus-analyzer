Overview: The economy has traditionally been based on agriculture.              
Sugarcane has been the primary crop for more than a century, and in some        
years it accounts for 85% of exports. The government has been pushing           
the development of a tourist industry to relieve high unemployment,             
which recently amounted to one-third of the labor force. The white              
and Indian communities are substantially better off than other segments         
of the population, adding to the social tensions generated by poverty           
and unemployment. The economic well-being of Reunion depends heavily on         
continued financial assistance from France.
