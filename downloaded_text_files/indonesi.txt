ECONOMY                                                                         
Overview: Indonesia is a mixed economy with many socialist                      
institutions and central planning but with a recent emphasis on                 
deregulation and private enterprise. Indonesia has extensive natural            
wealth yet, with a large and rapidly increasing population, it remains a        
poor country. GDP growth in 1985-89 averaged about 4%, somewhat short of        
the more than 5% rate needed to absorb the 2.3 million workers annually         
entering the labor force. Agriculture, including forestry and fishing, is       
an important sector, accounting for 21% of GDP and over 50% of the labor        
force. The staple crop is rice. Once the world's largest rice importer,         
Indonesia is now nearly self-sufficient. Plantation crops--rubber and           
palm oil--and textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both export         
and job generation. Industrial output now accounts for 30% of GDP               
based on a supply of diverse natural resources, including crude oil,            
natural gas, timber, metals, and coal. Of these, the oil sector dominates       
the external economy, generating more than 20% of the government's              
revenues and 40% of export earnings in 1989. However, the economy's             
growth is very dependent on the continuing expansion of nonoil exports.         
Japan is Indonesia's most important customer and supplier of aid.
