Overview: Thailand, one of the more advanced developing countries               
in Asia, enjoyed a year of 9% growth in 1990, although down from the            
double-digit rates of 1987-89. The increasingly sophisticated                   
manufacturing sector benefited from export-oriented investment, but             
the agricultural sector contracted 2%, primarily because of weaker              
demand in Thailand's major overseas markets for commodities such as             
rice. The trade deficit almost doubled in 1990, to $9 billion, but              
earnings from tourism ($4.7 billion), remittances, and net capital              
inflows helped keep the balance of payments in surplus. The government          
has followed fairly sound fiscal and monetary policies, aided by                
increased tax receipts from the fast-moving economy. In 1990 the                
government approved new projects--especially for telecommunications             
and roads--needed to refurbish the country's now overtaxed                      
infrastructure. Although growth in 1991 will slow further, Thailand's           
economic outlook remains good, assuming the continuation of prudent             
government policies in the wake of the 23 February 1991 military coup.
