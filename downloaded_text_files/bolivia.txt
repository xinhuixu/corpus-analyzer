Overview: The Bolivian economy steadily deteriorated between                    
1980 and 1985 as La Paz financed growing budget deficits by expanding           
the money supply and inflation spiraled--peaking at 11,700%. An austere         
orthodox economic program adopted by newly elected President Paz                
Estenssoro in 1985, however, succeeded in reducing inflation to between         
10% and 20% annually since 1987, eventually restarting economic growth.         
President Paz Zamora has retained the economic policies of the previous         
government, keeping inflation down and continuing the moderate growth           
begun under his predecessor. Nevertheless, Bolivia continues to be one of       
the poorest countries in Latin America, and it remains vulnerable to            
price fluctuations for its limited exports--agricultural products,              
minerals, and natural gas. Moreover, for many farmers, who constitute           
half of the country's work force, the main cash crop is coca, which is          
sold for cocaine processing.
